Tk::Zinc - another Canvas which proposes many new functions, some based on openGL

Tk::Zinc for Perl/Tk is available for Linux, Windows and MacOSX. 
the easiest way could be to use he CPAN. However new releases are usually 
first available on www.tkzinc.org/


* On a Linux system, you need Perl (>= 5.6) and perl-tk (800 or 804) packages.

* On MacOSX you need:
  - fink with tk-pm package and its dependencies (http://fink.sf.net)
    tk-pm is available in unstable. You can add this binary unstable tree to you /sw/etc/apt/sources.list:
    deb http://fink.opendarwin.org/bbraun 10.3/unstable main crypto
    deb http://fink.opendarwin.org/bbraun 10.3/stable main crypto
  - X11 et X11 sdk from Apple (http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/)

* On WinXP you need:
  - perl and perl-tk 804, 
  - Visual C++ or the Free Visual C++ Command Line Tools



Install:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  # to run demos before installing:
  perl -Iblib/arch -Iblib/lib demos/zinc-demos
  make install


WATCH OUT! On Linux it is quite frequent to have both Mesa and proprietary
           openGL libraries installed. This may lead to big problems at
           runtime if the linker picks the wrong library. It is often the
           the case between the static (libGL.a) Mesa library and the dynamic
           (libGL.so) NVidia library. It is very important to assert that
           the link is done with the library matching the openGL driver
           loaded in the X server.


up-to-date documentation is also available at http://www.tkzinc.org/index.php/Main/Documentation
You will find there the reference manual, a FAQ, a mailing list, its archive
etc...
The source of the reference manual is available in the full source package,
which also includes TkZinc for Tcl/Tk, for Perl/Tk, and for Python (Python binding
are now obsoletes).


After installation, we recommend you to launch the zinc-demos script,
a frontend to more than 30 small demos.

For more information on building Tk::Zinc, a README is available in 
the tkzinc-*tgz tar file (on Tkzinc web site) used for building all
flavor of TkZinc (ie tcl, perl and python)
