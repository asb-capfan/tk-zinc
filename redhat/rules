$Description = "Zinc is a canvas like widget for the Tk toolkit. Its has been
 designed to provide a structured organization of its graphical
 components. It provides also advanced geometrical and graphical
 capabilities such as geometric construction (boolean ops),
 transformations, non rectangular clipping gradient fills, smart
 reliefs, etc.

This contains the dynamic libraries that are necessary for
running applications which use Zinc.";
